# eye-excercise
Simple eye movement exercise.
This project consists of a webpage where two eyes in the middle of the screen follow the mouse cursor wherever it goes.

**How to Run** 

Open up the project and move your mouse cursor around the page. The pair of eyes will follow the cursor wherever it goes. 

**Roadmap of future improvements**

Many improvements could be added to this project. We could expand from just the eyes animation to add lips, nose, eyebrows and other features.
These features could be responsive in new ways. Such as clicking on certain features could cause a reaction.
Add personalization options such as changing the background color, or the size/shape/color of the eyes.
